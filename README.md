[Image](http://www.centralconnection.org/s/1553/images/editor/alumni_pages/hadwin_jamie.jpg)<p>My name is Jamie, and I am a perpetual student, communications professional, social justice champion and lover of dogs!</p>
<p>I am currently the Marketing Manager for the University of Central Oklahoma Development office, which means I get to work for both the UCO Foundation and the UCO Alumni Association. I recently completed my master's in mass communications, and I am now taking courses to get a certificate in Crime Victim/Survivor Services. I am interested in one day pursuing a law degree.</p>

Prior to UCO, I was a program coordinator (with a heavy emphasis on communications and events) for the Oklahoma State University High Performance Computing Center. Before that, I worked in the OSU College of Arts & Sciences as a communications and event specialist. 

So what have I covered:
<li>Perpetual student ✔️</li>
<li>Communications Professional ✔️</li>
<li>Social justice champion ✔️</li>
<li>Lover of dogs...can't forget that!</li>

Gratuitous dog picture!
